Senseless child
See you now
Still worth nothing
Never stop, until it stops

Rise and shine
Fall in line
Still worth nothing
That we know seems to show

See him walking around
It's a known fact that
The only thing he knows is this
Hear him talking so loud
It's a rough world
And he can find out for himself, he'll see
Speed up, slow down, go all around
In the end

Came to see
Conveniently
Still worth nothing
After all, some must fall

See him walking around
It's a known fact that
The only thing he knows is this
Hear him talking so loud
It's a rough world
And he can find out for himself, he'll see
Speed up, slow down, go all around
In the end
