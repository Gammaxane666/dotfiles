Dance to Kuduro (Plop, Plop, Plop…)

Lucenzo

The King!

Put your hands up
Moving only the hips
Turn half around
Dance to Kuduro
Don't lose your breath now
Because this has just started
Move your head
Dance to Kuduro

Put your hands up
Moving only the hips
Turn half around
Dance to Kuduro
Don't lose your breath now
Because this has just started
Move your head
Dance to Kuduro

Who's going to control the power of this wicked feeling that now gets through your veins,
and the heat like the sun that can't let you be still at the beat, babe
Who's going to stop this feeling that makes your hips lose control as you dance, (sexxy!)
This fire burning inside you slowly is gonna get you wild

Moving only the hips
Turn half around
